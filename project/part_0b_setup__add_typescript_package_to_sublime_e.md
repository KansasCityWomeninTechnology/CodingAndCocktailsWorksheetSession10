### Part 0B: Setup | Add TypeScript Package to Sublime Editor {#part-0b-setup-add-typescript-package-to-sublime-editor}

Using TypeScript with Angular2, provides us a lot of shortcuts. However, to make sure the correct words highlight for us in Sublime (remember the pretty colors youâ€™ve seen in HTML &amp; CSS files?), and that we get some of the autosuggest features of TypeScript, we have to install the TypeScript package for Sublime.

1.  Open Sublime Text Editor and hold down these 3 keys to open the Command Palette:Mac: `cmd + shift + p`  |  Windows: `ctrl + shift + p`
2.  In the Command Palette input field, type: install
3.  Find and select: Package Control: Install Package![](images/image29.png)

1.  The Package Manager pops open another input field. In this one type: TypeScript
2.  Find &amp; select the TypeScript package that matches this description:![](images/image38.png)
3.  Setup is done! Give high fives to those around you.
